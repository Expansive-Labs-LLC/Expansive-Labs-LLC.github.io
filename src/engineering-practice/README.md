## Engineering Practice Collaboration Space

This space is dedicated to collaboratively defining and documenting our engineering practices. Our goal is to:

* **Standardize:** Create consistent, repeatable processes across our engineering teams.
* **Scale:** Ensure our practices can support the company's growth and evolving needs.
* **Improve:** Continuously refine our processes based on data, feedback, and best practices.
* **Share:** Make our knowledge accessible to all engineers, fostering transparency and knowledge sharing.

By documenting and sharing our engineering practices, we can improve efficiency, quality, and innovation across the organization.
