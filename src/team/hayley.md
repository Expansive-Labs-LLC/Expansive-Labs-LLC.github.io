**Hayley Blackman**
**Creating thoughtful digital experiences—from front-end design to DevOps automation.**

Hayley brings a multidisciplinary perspective to tech, backed by degrees in Computer Information Sciences from Wayne County Community College and Healthcare Technology and Systems from Ultimate Medical Academy. Over the past year and a half, she has focused on mastering modern DevOps workflows—diving deep into GitHub best practices, AWS management, and building custom GitHub Actions to streamline and automate development processes.

Her technical foundation includes strong front-end experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, complemented by working knowledge of Linux/Unix systems and a growing skill set in back-end development. This diverse background enables her to bridge intuitive design with scalable, efficient infrastructure.

At Expansive Labs, Hayley is passionate about building smarter, end-to-end solutions that combine clean interfaces with powerful automation—contributing to innovation at every layer of the stack.
