With a strong background in graphic design and years of experience in business leadership, I’ve successfully led multiple ventures—managing teams and operations across several locations and serving as the Owner-Operator of Capsule Novelties. I also founded and ran a nonprofit dedicated to supporting the circus and flow arts community, and owned a circus toy company where I designed and created custom circus equipment and fire props from concept to completion. My passion lies in creativity, innovation, and building meaningful, artistic brands from the ground up.
