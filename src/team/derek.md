**Derek DeJonghe**
**A Journey of Innovation and Cloud Expertise**

Derek DeJonghe's passion for technology and innovation began early. Even as a young entrepreneur, Derek was already building his first business at the age of 10, providing lawn care and snow removal services to his community using his father's tractor. This early experience instilled in him a strong work ethic, a knack for problem-solving, and the drive to create solutions.

This entrepreneurial spirit has been a constant throughout Derek's career. With over 10 years of cloud consulting experience, he excels at helping organizations optimize their development cycle and application delivery. Derek founded Expansive Labs in July 2023, where he currently advises startups on cloud operations and software agility.

Prior to founding Expansive Labs, Derek held several key leadership positions at RightBrain Networks for over 10 years, including Vice President of Engineering and Director of Cloud Architecture. During his time there, he oversaw technical delivery, managed services, and technical partnership audits, enabling his team to excel. Derek also served as Principal Cloud Solutions Architect, leading multiple cloud migration, refactoring, and greenfield application development projects. He has a proven track record of designing and building resilient cloud architectures and is recognized as the highest technical escalation point within RightBrain Networks. 

Derek's expertise spans a broad range of technologies and skills, including Python, Nginx, and Amazon Web Services (AWS). He is an AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate, AWS Certified DevOps Engineer - Professional, and AWS Certified SysOps Administrator - Associate.  Derek is also a published author, with works including "Load Balancing in the Cloud: Practical Solutions with NGINX and AWS," "NGINX Cookbook (Part 1) Advanced Recipes for High Performance Load Balancing," "NGINX Cookbook, 2nd Edition," "NGINX Cookbook (Part 2) Security," and "NGINX Unit Cookbook: Recipes for Using a Versatile Open Source Server."
