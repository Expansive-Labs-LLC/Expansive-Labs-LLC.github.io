# Experimental Rap

This playlist is my secret weapon. I want to share this playlist that has significantly impacted my work, productivity, and confidence. Its primarily 90s inspired hip-hop and conversational rap, and heavily lyric driven. It represents power and creativity. These tracks resonate with me on a deep level, reminding me of my inner strength and drive. I listen to it every single day.

It helps me focus, boosts my confidence, and fuels my creativity. I believe everyone deserves to feel empowered and energized, and this playlist can be a powerful tool. I encourage you to try it out and let me know what you think.
